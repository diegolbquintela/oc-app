# Transactions Tracker (MERN)

> Full stack transactions tracker.
> Will evolve in the future to a Holdings tracker, where users will be able to add assets and track their performances.

Currently, Authentication is under development. The UI is almost ready, requiring only client-side authentication for a better user experience. The backend is being built.

Adding transactions is easy, just type quantity and price of acquisition. In the future these will be consolidated into a holdings screen, with charts and performance.
